    WHAT IS APPLE?
    </h1>
  
  <div >An apple is a round, edible fruit produced 
    by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard 
    apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are 
    the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 
    The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, 
    Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for 
    thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to 
    North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and
     mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, 
     Greek, and European Christian tradition.</div>
